# Tasks Backlog

This directory is the project backlog for work items being developed in this repository.

Use subdirectories by task type:

- `bugs/`: stories for bugs
- `feats/`: stories for new features
- `chores/`: stories for non-bug and non-feature work (docs, dev tools config, environment changes, LLM upkeep)
- `llm/`: stories specifically for improving the LLM experience (docs, commands, rules, workflows)
- `tech/`: stories for technical experiments and other work not covered above

Task files are standard Markdown files created from the templates and naming rules defined in `.llm/rules/creating_tasks.mdc`.
