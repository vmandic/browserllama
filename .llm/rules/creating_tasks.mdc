# How to Create Task Files

## Location
All task files must be created under `tasks/` at the project root.

Use this exact task-type mapping:

| Task type | Directory | Filename prefix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bug | `tasks/bugs/` | `bugfix-` |
| Feature | `tasks/feats/` | `feat-` |
| Chore | `tasks/chores/` | `chore-` |
| LLM | `tasks/llm/` | `llm-` |
| Tech | `tasks/tech/` | `tech-` |

## Filename Convention
Task files must use these filename templates:
- `bugfix-00001_<title>.md`
- `feat-00001_<title>.md`
- `chore-00001_<title>.md`
- `llm-00001_<title>.md`
- `tech-00001_<title>.md`

Rules:
- Use only the mapped prefix for the selected task type.
- Use a 5-digit, zero-padded number (`00001`, `00002`, ...).
- Add a short title segment after the number.
- Title segment must be lowercase with words separated by underscores.
- Title segment must be at most 6 words.
- Keep the `.md` extension.
- Do not add suffixes, extra words, or dates in the filename.

Sequence rules:
- Numbering is scoped by prefix within its task directory.
- New file uses the next available number for that prefix.
- Do not reuse or renumber existing task files.

## File Content Template
All task files are Markdown files and must include these sections:

- `# Title`
- `# What`
- `# Why`
- `# How`
- `# Definition of Done`

Bug task exception:
- Bug task files must include `# How to reproduce`.
- For bug tasks, include `# How to reproduce` before `# How`.
- Heading names must match exactly (same spelling and capitalization).
- The `# Title` value must match the filename title segment in human-readable form.

## Standard Template (feat/chore/llm/tech)
```markdown
# Title
Initial UI and UX improvements

# What

# Why

# How

# Definition of Done
```

## Bug Template
```markdown
# Title
Fix popup status indicator encoding

# What

# Why

# How to reproduce

# How

# Definition of Done
```

## Creation Workflow
1. Determine the task type (bug, feature, chore, llm, tech).
2. Map the type to directory and prefix using the table above.
3. Find existing files with that prefix in that directory.
4. Pick the next available 5-digit number.
5. Define a concise title of up to 6 words.
6. Convert the title to lowercase underscore format for filename suffix.
7. Create `<prefix><number>_<title>.md` in that directory.
8. Fill required headings using the correct template.
9. If type is bug, include `# How to reproduce` before `# How`.

## Writing Guidelines
- Keep content concise and actionable.
- `# Title`: short human-readable task title matching the filename suffix.
- `# What`: state the change clearly.
- `# Why`: explain expected value or problem solved.
- `# How`: list implementation steps in execution order.
- `# Definition of Done`: include measurable, verifiable outcomes.
- For bugs, `# How to reproduce` should include deterministic repro steps.

## Validation Checklist
- File is in the correct `tasks/<type>/` directory.
- Filename exactly matches `<prefix>-NNNNN_<title>.md`.
- Filename title suffix uses lowercase words separated by underscores and is at most 6 words.
- Number is the next available for that prefix.
- `# Title` heading exists and matches the filename title in readable form.
- Required headings exist exactly as defined.
- Bug tasks include `# How to reproduce` before `# How`.
