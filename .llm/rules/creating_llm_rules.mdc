# How to Create Rule Files

## Location
All rule files must be placed in the `.llm/rules/` directory at the project root.

## Purpose
Rule files provide persistent instructions and context for LLM agents working on this project. They should capture:
- Project-specific conventions and patterns
- Development workflows and processes
- Testing and validation procedures
- Decision-making guidelines
- Context that agents need to work effectively

## File Format
- Use Markdown format for Cursor (`.mdc` extension)
- Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `testing_guide.mdc`, `api_conventions.mdc`)
- Use lowercase with underscores for rule filenames to distinguish them from regular documentation

## Structure Guidelines
Each rule file should include:
1. **Clear heading** - What domain or aspect does this rule cover?
2. **Specific, actionable instructions** - Avoid vague guidance
3. **Context** - Why these rules exist (when helpful)
4. **Examples** - Show correct usage where appropriate

## Writing Style
- Be concise and direct
- Use bullet points for lists of rules
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Prefer "do X" over "you should do X"
- Avoid redundancy with other rule files

## Scope
- **Project rules** - Apply to all work in this project
- **Domain-specific rules** - Cover specific areas (testing, API design, etc.)
- **Integration rules** - How different parts of the system interact

## When to Create a New Rule File
Create a new rule file when:
- You have a set of related instructions that agents should always follow
- You're capturing conventions that aren't obvious from the code
- You need to prevent repeated mistakes or clarify common confusion
- You want to document a workflow that spans multiple files or steps

## When to Update Existing Rules
Update rule files when:
- Instructions become outdated due to project changes
- New patterns or conventions emerge
- Existing rules are unclear or incomplete
- Conflicts or gaps between rules are discovered

## Rule Precedence
- Rules in subdirectories take precedence over parent directory rules
- Project rules (with file paths) take precedence over personal rules
- When in doubt, more specific rules override general rules
